;;  Phrase structure schemata
;;

; Headed phrases must obey the Head Feature Principle and the Revised Marking
; Principle.  They do not all obey the NLFP with respect to QUE, but it
; appears that all CLAUSE phrases account for QUE on mother and non-head-dtr.
; Hence moved the QUE coreference to NON-CLAUSE.  Headed phrases also identify
; the value of AGR on mother and head daughter, unlike e.g. the coordination 
; schemata which identify HEAD but not AGR.  
;; DPF 2012-03-23: Interestingly, this identification of AGR might shed some
;; light on which daughter is the head in the proper-name phrase |Kim Browne|
;; since |[Kim and Mary] Browne| shows plural agreement when it's the subject.
;; We have been treating these proper-name compounds pretty much like other
;; nominal compound phrases, all of which have the right dtr as the head.
;; FIX, one way or the other.
;; DPF 2017-11-17: And note that we currently don't treat titles as heads in
;; |Mr. Browne|, but for |Mr. and Mrs. Browne| we want the NP to have plural
;; number, so if this generalization about headed phrases is right, then the
;; title will have to be the head of the NP.

; Since MOD is a head feature, and projections of finite verbs can be relative

; declarative head_subj phrases be [MC bool].  Thus relative clauses must also 
; be [MC na].
;
; DPF 27-May-99 - Avoid making rel_cl a headed_phrase, so it can be marked as

; to block "*Sandy likes the man walks" and "*Sandy likes the man who thinks 
; went home", we require the S/NP to be [ MC + ], which excludes subject
; extraction for that daughter.

; The dtr is required to be [MC +] in order to block subject-extracted S/NPs
; from being admitted as relative clauses.  This constraint would be removed
; for those dialects which accept examples like "There's a man wants to talk to
; you waiting outside."

; ERB (14-12-97) I am trying to get the non-finite ones to work and to
; have only one type that will make both "The man Kim likes" and "The
; man to talk to" (but not "The man to talk to Sandy".)  The new
; constraints are: on the head-dtr HEAD verb, VFORM fin_or_inf, and
; SUBJ list(pro).  I also need to make to_c_prop HEAD verb and 
; MC +.  The latter is because we want to require MC + of the head-dtr
; to exclude subject extraction as above, adn to exclude that-declaratives
; from being the head-dtr of this cx.  (To avoid a really ugly second
; parse for "The man that Kim likes.")

; ERB (14-12-97) to_c_prop doesn't have to be a verb.  non_wh_rel_cl
; can just say HEAD verbal -- that-decls will be ruled out because they
; are MC -.  To_c_prop has to be MC + anyway because we need the
; MC + on the head-dtr in order to bar subj extractions from this
; cx.

; ERB (19-01-98) MC + moved to appropriate subtype.  See notes below.

; ERB (19-01-98) Part of what's keeping to_c_prop from serving directly
; as a modifier without first building a non_wh_rel is that hadj requires
; SUBJ *olist* and pro_ss is OPT -.  This means that non_wh_rel_cl can't
; copy up the SUBJ requirement.  I don't know what exactly the constraints
; are on the other valence features, so I am just copying them up for now.

; "how many books are t"

; DPF (06-Sept-98) Added reg_nom_rel constraint on MOD..MIN

; meet next week to celebrate".  
; DPF (27-Jan-99) Updated this to non_temp_nom_rel.
; DPF 09-Jan-00 - Added HD-DTR..MODIFD notmod_or_rmod to block

; new"
; DPF 17-Mar-01 - Moved [ MOD..MIN non_temp_nom_rel ] to inf_non_wh_rel_cl rule
; only, since we want phrases like "the day he arrived".
; DPF 20-Mar-01 - Added MOD..MODIFD notmod_or_lmod to prevent thatless-rels
; from modifying already-modified nominals, especially with a full relative
; clause: *the book that I bought you have is long"
; DPF 26-Mar-01 - But this is too strong, also blocking "the city in Germany I 
; wanted to visit was Berlin".  So instead use RPERIPH feature.
; DPF 11-Sept-01 - Added [MOD..SPR synsem] to block e.g. 'there to be arriving'
; DPF 24-Apr-03 - Also removed MOD..MIN non_temp_nom_rel from inf_non_wh_rel_cl
; since it prevents e.g. 'a good time to meet would be tomorrow'  We'll see 
; what it was blocking.

; (ERB 2003-08-08) Add a type for instrument infinitival relatives,
; like "the Fedex number to return my package.  These are similar
; to ordinary infinitival relatives, except that we need to hallucinate
; a SLASH value and a _with_p_rel, and make the index of the SLASH
; be the ARG2 of the _with_p_rel.  Since non_wh_rel_cl introduces
; a SLASH value, the new type can't inherit from it directly.  Add
; a supertype basic_non_wh_rel_cl that has the rest of the constraints
; from non_wh_rel_cl.  Hmmm... it seems that there might be no need
; for that slash value, as non_wh_rel_cl just takes the MIN and INDEX
; and zeros it out.  I have no idea what we'd put in for that KEYREL, and
; the INDEX can be identified with the ARG2 of the_with_p_rel.

; ERB (19-01-98) As much as it hurts, I don't think it is possible
; to avoid differentiating a inf and fin non_wh_rel_cl.  The facts of
; (Standard American) English seem to be that finite non-wh relatives
; do not allow extraction of the highest subject, but non-finite ones
; do:
;
; (1) Kim likes the book Sandy bought.
; (2) *Kim likes the person buys books.
; (3) Kim found a book to buy for Sandy.
; (4) Kim found a person to buy Sandy a book.
;
; A simple hack involving case won't work, because embedded subjects
; can be extracted in the finite case:
;
; (5) Sandy likes the program Kim thinks works.
;
; Another tack is to treat (3) and (4) above differently, where
; the to in (3) is to_c_prop and the to in (4) is to_c_nonprop.
; The motivation for this is that the former allows a discourse
; PRO interpretation, while the latter doesn't, so it is tempting
; to says that the latter doesn't involve PRO at all.  The idea is
; that to_c_prop builds a non_wh_rel which can then serve as a 
; modifier, while to_c_nonprop has a MOD value to start off with,
; and can be a modifier directly once it builds a hd-cmp_u_c.  To_c_nonprop
; would bind the index of its MOD value to that of its subject.
;
; However, this is unsatisfactory for several reasons.  First, the
; ones like (4), built with to_c_nonprop, have no message for the
; relative.  Second, since MOD is a head feature now, to_c_prop must
; also be MOD < nbar > .  Once this is true, there is no obvious way to
; keep it from serving directly as a modifier without building a
; non_wh_rel. Finally, we run into problems with lexical SLASH
; amalgamation.  Something has to be said about the subject value of
; to_c_nonprop, otherwise it runs the risk of having a non-terminated
; SLASH value.  However, on the one hand, to_c_nonprop is the to of
; raising constructions, so sometimes its SUBJ must be able to be
; canonical_synsem, and on the other, on this analysis, it can also
; head modifiers in which its SUBJ goes unexpressed.  To take care
; of the latter, something must be said in the lexical entry, but
; unexpressed is not compatible with canonical_synsem.
;
; The only other possibility I can see is to let the subject extraction
; apply lower, as in to [like Sandy] in [a person to like Sandy], but
; this requires letting subject extraction apply to base forms, which
; would most likely be a royal mess.
;
; In sum, given the facts of SAE and the rest of the grammar as
; it is, (3) and (4) must be built with the same to.  In (3) there
; is an extracted complement and in (4) there is an extracted 
; subject.  In the case of infinitival non_wh_rels, the grammar
; doesn't care.  In the case of finite ones, it does.
;

;; |*the cats either we love or we hate|.
;; Note that we still overgenerate for

;; but this will be harder to block since we need to allow conjoined S after
;; the first `that' in order to get one of the good readings for
;; |the cat whose tail we admire and Kim hates| where it's the tail Kim hates.
;; Alas, we'll also wrongly get this reading for

; (ERB 2003-08-08) Switch to nonprop to phrases so that I can still
; get at the handle for the verb relation within the clause (which
; should be the ARG1 of the with_p_rel).  The other options (using

; (illegal per the alegbra) or to introduce a slash value on the

; DPF 26-jun-03 - Added rule for making participial phrases into virtual

; too little value.
; DPF 10-dec-03 - Tried restricting the  mother to POSTHD +, but this loses

; but not yet clear how to do that.
; DPF 22-apr-04 - Corrected handle-linking to get the right semantics
; (making "kim arrived singing" analogous to "Kim arrived while singing").
; This rule should be generalized to include at least depictive adjectives
; and maybe also passive participles if we can find an argument that we need
; both analyses for e.g. "kim arose assisted by her nurse" - but cf. "Kim
; arose unassisted (by her nurse)" which suggests "assisted" may be adjectival,
; so maybe we don't have to open the door to also let in passives here.
; DPF 18-jul-04 - Added MOD..MSG message to reduce ambiguity, as in
; 'Kim is interviewing'
; DPF 27-jul-04 - Try allowing passives, but require that these phrases be
; preceded by a comma to reduce ambiguity.
; DPF 20-aug-04 - Generalize this rule to allow depictive adjectives as well,
; as in "Kim left, angry at Sandy", but split into two, in order to enforce
; comma separation from modified phrase.
; DPF 30-sept-04 - Since we want "Having arrived, Kim arose." but still want
; to block "*Kim is having arrived", we can't require the dtr to be PRD +,
; so here we compromise, and allow sentence-initial "having..." but not (yet)
; sentence-final, since it isn't clear how to exclude non-predicative adjs.
; DPF 7-mar-05 - Removed identification of MOD..AGR and ARGS..CONT.XARG, which 
; was motivation by e.g. "Seeing Kim, we left", but is incompatible with 
; expletive main clauses, like "Given his record, it was obvious that he would 
; be convicted."
; DPF 12-mar-05 - Constrained XARG of dtr to be non_expl-ind, to exclude 
; expletive it-taking phrases, such as "Kim arrived, possible that Abrams 
; arose"
; DPF 29-mar-05 - Re 18-jul-04, this blocks e.g. "After measuring the height
; using a ruler, we emerged", so let's try removing this hack to see if we
; can live with the added (necessary) ambiguity.
; DPF 27-sept-05 - Try making SPR empty for these phrases, to avoid ambiguity
; for e.g. "just laughing" where was attaching to mother as well as daughter.
; DPF 18-jul-07 - Consistent with blocking of PP modifiers to auxiliaries,
; let's try imposing same restriction on depictives, to avoid spurious
; ambiguity for e.g. "Kim would appear prominent."
; DPF 06-sept-07 - Add constraint on MOD..MOD to exclude attachment of 
; these subconj phrases to relative clauses, to avoid spurious analysis for
; e.g. "the cat we should be connected arrives."
; DPF 30-jun-09 - Re 30-sept-04: Now that "having arrived" is not marked for
; PRD, restore PRD + on dtr, in order to prevent reduced-relative VPs from
; being dtr in this rule (as they are PRD -).
; DPF 2010-09-17 - Removed C-CONT..INDEX non_conj_event, since we are now
; (correctly) unifying the phrase's INDEX with that of the modifiee, which
; might of course be conjoined, as in "Kim was happy and surprised, winning."
;; DPF 2016-10-04 - Pushed MOD..RPERIPH - down to subtypes, since we want at

;; DPF 2016-01-25 - The RPUNCT on the mother's MOD value can't just be

;; DPF 2016-10-27 - Re 2012-12-21: But we also want predicative modifiers marked

;; the second dtr's MOD to be HEAD n_or_v.
;; DPF 2016-12-16 - Changed mother's MOD..RPERIPH from - to na_or_-, since we

;; DPF 2017-09-05 - Constrained left dtr to be SORT norm-entity-or-event in

;; DPF 2017-09-06 - Re 2016-01-25: Okay, did the split into two rules, to avoid
;; spurious analyis for |Jerome has fifty dollars he saved.|
;; DPF 2017-10-09 - Re 2017-09-05: But this blocks |the idea being that we win|,
;; so remove, since anyway we do want to allow (nominalizations of) WH-clauses 
;; as first argument, as in |we cheered, who won being the source of our joy|.
;; DPF 2018-04-21 - The surprising SUBJ *anti_null* on the mother blocks these
;; in the head_marker phrase we would need for |we left, Kim angry and Chiang
;; furious|.  So let's try just making it the empty list, and see what might
;; go wrong.
;; DPF 2018-04-21 - Also generalized right dtr's RPUNCT to allow no_punct, so
;; we can get the example above where the first conjunct is not right-punct-
;; marked.
;; DPF 2018-06-01 - For efficiency, it is tempting to prevent these as

;; they do appear with some frequency in the first conjunct of a conjoined VP,
;; as in |they made a donation, most of it as cash, and were thanked| (see
;; wsj01d:20187008).  We also do see them as pre-VP modifiers, as in
;; |the child, his arms flailing, fell off the fence|.  So instead let's split
;; this type into pre- and post-modifying, and make the pre-mod be comma-marked.

; The version of the Non-local Feature Principle here assumes that there will
; only be one value on the SLASH list.  To handle multiple gaps, we'll need
; more general set-manipulation functions.  This version also doesn't use a
; distinction between INHERITED and TO-BIND non-local features.  Instead, it
; treats non-local features like valence features.

; ERB (17-10-96) in order to get "Kim knows who to ask" under the current
; hacks (i.e., no PRO), I need a head_filler_phrase that takes something like
; "to ask" (i.e., VFORM in, SUBJ nomp) as its head.  So I am making a
; separate parallel type that will only be inherited by the embedded wh
; nonfinite questions.

; N.B. Since all head_filler constructions inherit from type clause, which
; inherits from head_compositional, this type does not (though it could,
; redundantly).

; Added [ SUBJ *prolist* ] constraint to NH-DTR, to ensure termination
; of the QUE and REL attributes now that we're doing lexical threading, and
; PPs (among others) wouldn't otherwise know if they were QUE empty or not.
;
; (DPF 23-Aug-98) But if we make the SUBJ *prolist*, then we can't get 
; extraction of raising predicates, as in "how does Kim look", since the
; subject of the "how" adjective is identified with that of "look".  Hence
; we move this constraint to the extracted-adjunct rule, since it seems to
; hold true for adjuncts, but not for complements.
; DPF 23-Sept-99 - Made mother be POSTHD +, to avoid clauses as prenominal
; modifiers.
; DPF 11-Dec-00 - Removed SPR < > from mother, to allow sentence-initial PP
; modifiers for WH-questions.
; DPF 03-nov-03 - Moved SPR < > to head_filler_phrase so it does
; not hold for relative clause head-filler phrases, to block analysis for e.g.
; 'when we arrive in Berlin' as RELS+PP.
; DPF 18-jun-04 - Replaced parent basic_binary_phrase with binary_phrase to
; get PUNCT attributes inherited.  This predicts the INFLECTD features that
; were stipulated, but also adds propagation of GENRE, which might cause
; surprises.
; DPF 21-jul-04 - Moved HD-DTR.QUE 0-dlist from this type to the non-fin and
; non-wh subtypes, in order to allow in-situ WH phrases in combination with
; WH phrases, as in "who hired whom", and to allow ?-punctuation (which also
; introduces a non-empty QUE in order to trigger sb-hd_q_c with interrogative
; semantics for "Abrams hired Browne?").

; ERB (03-10-96) hcomp_nc is no longer marked as non-clause because some of them
; are "clauses" in the sense of having a message (e.g., "Kim wants [to leave]").
; This is actually in need of revision: we are probably going to need to 
; distinguish between to-headed hcomp_ncs which are selected by equi predicates 
; or otherwise have PRO subjects and whether-headed hcomp_ncs on the one hand, 
; and all other instances on the other with a restriction equivalent to SUBJ 
; list(PRO) in order to block "To rain is difficult" etc.  I think this should 
; be possible without resorting to anything like VFORM whether to identify cases
; -- see Ivan's interrogatives paper.

; ERB (05-10-97) In order for one single hd-cmp_u_c rule to build things like "how
; about on Friday", the restriction HEAD subst needs to be removed from this
; rule, or else root-marker needs to inherit from subst.  I am opting for the
; former.

; DPF (25-Aug-98) The head_comp_phrase is not marked POSTHD + since we want to
; build "twenty-one" using this rule, but still allow it to serve as a
; prenominal modifier  as in "twenty-one books".  So instead we use the PRED
; feature to distinguish prenominal from postnominal modifiers, and conspire to
; make all PRED - entries have an empty COMPS list.  
; DPF 01-Feb-03 - Generalized CONJ value to cnil_or_numconj, to allow this
; rule to build "and three" as in "two hundred and three".
; DPF 10-dec-03 - But now the mrk-nh_atom_c rule is taking care of these guys.
; DPF 10-jul-04 - Tried making complement LPUNCT no_punct to avoid 
; 'Kim hired, Abrams'. But this fails for "January 1st, 1984".  So remove, 
; and expect heads to declare the expected LPUNCT value for their complements.
; DPF 17-jul-04 - Let's try making the head LPUNCT no_punct, to avoid e.g.
; 'Kim, hired, Sandy.'
; DPF 25-aug-04 - Can't have [HD-DTR..RPUNCT no_punct] since for two-compl
; verbs, the first complement might contain an appositive ending in a comma,
; as in "Kim sent [Abrams, the manager,] to Browne.  So it seems that we
; have to live with ambiguity of "Kim sent Abrams, the manager."
; DPF 7-mar-05 - Changed parent type from head_initial_infl to head_initial
; since we want "the Berlin - Paris route" where "Berlin - Paris" is built
; compositionally but is still compatible with [INFL -].  Keep nonhd-dtr as
; INFLECTD +.
; DPF 31-mar-05 - Re 25-aug-04, tried changing hdn-np_app-pr_c rule to underspecify 
; RPUNCT value, so this HCOMP rule can return to excluding a comma-marked head,
; which should help with spurious ambiguity.  But if hdn-np_app-pr_c rule drops the
; information from its RPUNCT, no longer know if it was marked with final comma,
; or clause_punct, etc - unacceptable, so we'll just live with generating
; 'Kim handed Abrams, the book.'
; DPF 28-jun-07 - Made phrase be SYNSEM nonlex_synsem to prevent PPs from
; being complements of v_p_le verbs, given that we now depend on the SYNSEM
; type to distinguish P from PP for these particle guys.
; DPF 15-sept-07 - Re 7-mar-05: But leaving INFLECTD underspecified means we
; always build spurious edges for e.g. 'hire Abrams' which don't go very far,
; but are unwanted.  So let's try requiring the two dtrs to both be INFLECTD +
; but leave the mother unspecified, so we still get "paris - berlin" as a
; left dtr of compound but avoid building uninflected "hire Abrams'
;; DPF 2020-04-30 - Re 23-Apr-03: For |clear evidence we needed that Kim won|,

;; DPF 2016-10-24 - We were constraining HD-DTR..INDEX to be non_conj_sement,
;; presumably to avoid spurious ambiguity somehow with coordination and 
;; extraction.  But this blocked extraction of a conjoined NP complement of
;; an empty prep, as in |Kim and Browne, we rely on|, since the index of the
;; PP/NP would be the index of the conjoined NP.
;; One reason for the constraint was to prevent spurious application of the
;; right-node-raising rule, which requires its dtr to be INDEX conj_ind, so
;; we blocked an RNR analysis of |is to arise|.  But in fact we should be
;; requiring |to arise| to constrain its own INDEX to be non_conj_event, which
;; then blocks the RNR rule anyway. Similarly, we want to get 
;; |how happy and wise is Kim?| where the xcmp phrase's index is the conjoined
;; event of the filler.
;; Still, we get a spurious parse for |kim is happy and wise| because the 
;; complement's index is conj_event, which is all the RNR rule wants. So take
;; advantage of the fact that extracted_arg_phrase stamps TPC + on the mother's
;; index, but this is not propagated through coordination, so the RNR rule can
;; require its dtr's head to be INDEX.--TPC -.
;; Alas, not quite right: since the index is shared for dtr and mother, the
;; resulting phrase is also --TPC -, but this means we can't later extract an
;; adjunct, as in |today we hired and fired him|, because the adj-extraction
;; rule also stamps --TPC + on the head.  So we need a different solution:
;; we'll use AUX - on the dtr of the RNR rule; see note there.
;; DPF 2017-11-16 - Re 31-May-07: Since we also want to enable extraction of

;; first fix the other thing:
;; Re 2010-09-16: Now that we want this bracketing for |May [23-25]|, the SPR
;; of |23-25| is not compatible with its own SPR list being unexpressed.  So
;; let's leave the spr-N subtype as is (with the SPR's SPR as *olist*), and
;; on the non-N subtype, we can't just make SPCMPS empty, because the analysis
;; of |as happy as Kim| has spr |as| combine first with |happy|, with a nonempty

;; itself allow an optional spr from which the head gets its SPCMPS value, to
;; ensure that we seal off the SPCMPS list for all such types.  FIX as needed.
;;
;; Now back to |ten to twelve|: For dofm |to|, have it constrain its SPR to
;; still have a non-empty COMPS list, so it can't undergo the optcomp rule, and
;; hence retains as visible its LOCAL type which |to| requires to be
;; noninfl_noun_local, avoiding spurious ambig for |June 10 - 12|.  
;; This hack doesn't work for hour nouns, since we want both 
;; |ten to twelve| and also |ten fifteen to twelve|.  
;; Conclusion: we'll live with the ambiguity for now but it looks like we 
;; really want INFLECTD to be a SYNSEM feature so lexical heads can constrain 
;; it on sprs and comps.  Cf. the various places where we currently use the
;; constraint [LOCAL noninfl_noun_local].
;; DPF 2018-01-07 - Tempted to add SLASH 0-dlist to nonhd-dtr, presuming we

; The SYNSEM value of the head of a head/modifier phrase is token-identical to
; the MOD value of the adjunct daughter.  Additionally, the adjunct daughter
; must be complement-saturated.  The SLASH value is not set in the basic
; schema, but rather in each of the subtypes: in head_mod_phrase_simple the
; SLASH value is passed up from both daughters, but in the
; extracted_adj_phrase the SLASH value of the mother is effectively the
; adjunct that would have modified the head.
; 
; DPF (6-Sept-98) Constrained HD-DTR to have empty QUE as well as REL, to 
; block adverbs modifying "how", "where", etc.  
; DPF (4-Mar-99) But this unfortunately also blocks "which consultant who fell"
; since making "consultant" be QUE empty means via lexical threading that its
; specifier must also be QUE empty.  So we would have to find some other way of
; blocking modifiers of "where" etc, but perhaps the generalization is wrong
; anyway; consider "right where", "exactly when" "just how".

; DPF 25-Aug-99 - Removed CONJ cnil from HD-DTR, to allow "oh, and your name"
; DPF 6-Apr-01 - Mysteriously, it seems that we have not been copying up ALTMIN
; from head-dtr to mother for head-mod phrases.  It showed up in failure to 
; notice that "first seven" had a non-empty ALTMIN, which was intended to 
; block this as left member of n-n-compound.

;; DPF 10-Feb-01 - Removed REL 0-dlist from head-dtr, since (a) head-nexus 
;; phrases pass the REL value from the head dtr to the mother; and (b) this 
;; was blocking e.g. "the chair whose first three legs fell off arrived" 
;; where the adj-N construction forces REL 0-dlist rather than passing up the 
;; spr's REL.
; DPF 2-Jun-02 - Added HS-LEX - (see discussion of HS-LEX) - needed if want to 
; distinguish "*the children singing are famous" from "the children singing in
; Berlin are famous" - may not be desirable.
; DPF 30-Apr-03 - The reentrancy of E-INDEX in head-dtr and C-CONT is dubious
; at best, and gives rise to the odd result that in "Kim sleeps in Berlin"
; both the ARG0 and the ARG1 attributes of the _in_rel are identified.  This
; looks like a possible violation at least in spirit of the semantic algebra,
; so why is it here?  More research is needed.
; DPF 25-Jun-03 - Restored [CONJ cnil] on mother (cf 25-Aug-99), since don't
; want "and Browne hired" as a head-adj constituent.
; DPF 09-may-04 - Removed HD-DTR..MIN independent_rel since it prevents e.g.
; 'Kim relies you know on Sandy'
; DPF 14-mar-05 - Added identity of POSTHD on hd-dtr and mother, to block
; e.g. adj "in" from subconj_prdp as in "kim arrived [in [on Tuesday]]"
; DPF 12-apr-08 - Re 25-Jun-03: Moved cnil down to head_adj_phrase, so
; can still get pre-head modifiers as in "yes, and Kim"
; DPF 30-jun-09 - We don't want to inherit from head_nexus_rel_phrase because

; Added restriction on adjunct's specifier to prevent unsaturated nouns
; (like 'afternoon') from serving as modifiers before they pick up their
; specifiers.

; head_mod_phrase_simple takes the MSG value from its non-head dtr's 
; MSG.  Most modifiers identify their message with their
; modifiee's message, but tags don't.  (Modifiers cannot simply identify their
; own message with that of their modifiee, since some signs (like "not")
; can be either a modifier or an argument, and hence need a message value 
; independent of that of their modifiee.

; SLASH of mother is append of SLASH lists for the two daughters.  In principle
; this allows distinct slash values on the two daughters, without enforcing
; parasitic gaps.  So we restrict the LIST.REST value of SLASH on the mother to
; be the empty list -- a hack which works in PAGE since not strictly typed, but 
; what we really want to say is that SLASH on the mother is either a singleton 
; list, or the empty list.

;; 15-Jun-98 Removed this hack, since it doesn't work in the LKB, and is wrong
;; anyway, failing to generalize to e.g. head-complement structures, which
;; present the same problem of distinct SLASH values coming from each of the
;; two daughters.

;; Removed identification of hddtr's MSG with mother's - wrong for tags,
;; at least.  Should be handled independently by each modifier.

;; DPF 26-Feb-99 - Added [ MIN independent_rel] to NH-DTR to distinguish
;; modifier phrases from verb-particle constructions, where the particle's
;; MIN is specialized to a subtype of 'selected_rel'.

;; DPF 7-Apr-99 - Moved C-CONT..INDEX to the scopal and intersective variants,
;; since intersectives take their index from the head-dtr, while scopals take
;; it from the non-head-dtr.  The crucial case for intersectives is for
;; participial modifiers of nouns, like "manager interviewing Browne" where
;; the index of the modifier is an event variable.

;; DPF 7-Jun-99 - Removed REL 0-dlist from nonhead, to allow slashed finite
;; rels to keep the REL value on their mother, so it can be distinguished from
;; ordinary clauses.

;; DPF 8-May-00 - MC of the mother is now determined by the modifier dtr, not
;; the head-dtr, in order to make discourse adverbs like "yes" produce MC +
;; phrases. 

;; DPF 10-Feb-01 - Removed REL 0-dlist from mother, since (a) head-nexus 
;; phrases get the REL value from the head dtr; and (b) this was blocking e.g.
;; "the chair whose first three legs fell off arrived" where the adj-N
;; construction forces REL 0-dlist rather than passing up the spr's REL.
; DPF 3-Jul-02 - Added re-entrancy of HD-DTR..LEX and NH-DTR..MOD..LEX
; to enable modifiers to constrain the lex/phr distinction of the modifiee.
; DPF 26-Apr-03 - Added identification of XARG for head-dtr and non-hd-dtr for
; scopal modifier rules, which was already done for the (non-nominal)
; intersective modifier rules - the adj_n_int_phrase cannot make this identity
; since nouns declare the XARG value to be 'nothing'.
; DPF 03-nov-03 - Changed MC propagation back to coming from head-dtr, since
; want to be able to attach modifiers (which might be MC na) to main clauses,
; as in "Kim laughed, especially because sandy stayed".
; DPF 06-mar-06 - Re 26-Apr-03: XARG of nouns is no longer 'nothing', but
; still don't want to identify XARG of two dtrs in intersective modification 
; rules, since the modifier's XARG can be identified with the INDEX of the
; head-dtr.
;; DPF 2018-02-12 - Constrained NH-DTR..MOD.FIRST to be expressed_synsem,
;; so we can exclude e.g. PP+PP copredication phrase which is only used in
;; non-modification structures including the copula and locative inversion.
;; DPF 2018-03-25 - Re 03-nov-03: For tag questions, we want the SF ques to come
;; from the modifier, but since the INDEX for the clause comes from the head,
;; the head clause must be MC - (because the subj-head main-clause rule 
;; identifies SF with the RPUNCT.PSF). So for scopal modifiers, MC will be 
;; determined by the modifier, normally passing up the MC value of the phrase 
;; it modifies.

; PRD +, in order to prevent finite VPs from serving as modifiers.  This was 
; being blocked earlier by pretending that all post-head modifiers had to have
; SUBJ *olist*, but this meant making predicative participles not specify an
; OPT value on their SUBJ - dubious generalization, and besides, it made it
; difficult to get the parse-node labels right, since passive verbs looked
; like S's.
;
; DPF 3-June-99 -- Further constrained nom_adj rule to make the modifier be
; phrasal, to block "Kim met the consultant hired." It's too strong a
; constraint, but we'll revisit the question if we move to making post-nominal
; modifiers attach at NP rather than N.  Among the disadvantages is the fact
; that we can't do "Get him something nice". (But see opt comp for generic-pro)
; DPF 9-Sept-99 - Added [PRD -] to head-dtr to avoid modifiers of e.g. 
; minute-word. 
; - 20-Nov-99: But this also blocked "the eleventh any time after three"
; DPF 15-Apr-00 - Removed [NH-DTR..SLASH 0-dlist] since now have
; relative clauses have non-empty REL value.  This means we have to split the 
; nn_adj rule into two, one for relative clauses which are REL 1-dlist and the
; other for reduced relatives which are REL 0-dlist - otherwise we would get 
; "*Kim bought a book by whom?".
; DPF 26-Mar-01 - Added [HD-DTR..RPERIPH na_or_-] to block e.g. attachment of
; post-nom modifiers to bare proper names and numerals.
; DPF 2-Jun-02 - Added NH-DTR.LEX - to exclude "the children angry"
; DPF 2-Jul-02 - (from 26-Mar-01) But attachment of post-nom modifiers to 
; proper names is possible, as in "Abrams from New York just called".  So
; removed this constraint, and leave for later how to block "Abrams by Browne
; arrived"
; DPF 3-Jul-02 - Try adding HD-DTR..NORM no_rel to exclude modification
; of np-adverbs like "here".
; DPF 13-Oct-02 - But why block this?  We want "here in Paris is nice" and
; "I'll arrive later that morning".  So remove it, and wait for motivation.
; DPF 23-aug-04 - Moved NH-DTR..LEX - from n_adj_int_phrase to n_adj_redrel_cl
; in order to allow postnominal participles like "the people hired were good"
; while still blocking e.g. "*the people happy were good"
; DPF 25-aug-04 - Change HD-DTR.LPUNCT from pair_or_no_punct to 
; comma_or_pair_or_no_punct to allow non-restrictive relatives and reduced
; relatives for now.
; DPF 06-apr-05 - Try constraining HD-DTR..RPUNCT to pair_or_no_punct, to

; DPF 04-may-05 - Constrain NH-DTR to QUE 0-dlist to block NP analysis of

; DPF 13-nov-05 - Changed HD-DTR..RPUNCT from rbc_or_pair_or_no_punct to

;; DPF 2016-07-03 - Preserved NEGPOL from hd-dtr to mother since this type
;; does not inherit from head_adj_int_phrase as one might expect.
;; DPF 2016-08-26 - Not clear why HD-DTR is INFLECTD na_or_+ while the mother
;; is stamped +, but this leads to spurious ambiguity for e.g. |we arose at

;; let's see what gets lost.  FIX?
;; DPF 2016-09-28 - For some time the hd-dtr has been stamped SLASH 0-dlist,
;; but this prevents free relatives such as |whatever cats in Paris we admire|
;; because the freerel-det has a non-empty slash, and slash-amalgamation then
;; fails to unify |whatever| with |cats in Paris|.  So remove, and let's see
;; if something goes amiss (FIX?).
;; DPF 2016-11-20 - Re 2016-08-26: What gets lost is modication of the rel
;; pronoun |that|, which is marked INFLECTD na, so we lose |the cat that on 
;; Tuesday disappeared|. So instead, we identify the INFLECTD value on hd-dtr
;; and mother.
;; DPF 2017-11-04 - In order to allow interposed relative clause between a noun
;; and its complement, as in |the claim we rejected that he arrived|, we push 
;; the COMPS < > constraint on head-dtr down to the reduced-relative subtype 
;; (since there is already a hd-aj_vmod_c rule that admits non-clausal 
;; noun modifiers before complements, as in |the claim yesterday that he 
;; arrived|.  But constrain COMPS here to be *obllist*, to avoid spurious 
;; ambig when attaching rel clause to a noun with an optional complement,
;; discharging the opt comp either before or after attaching the rel clause.

; DPF 10-jul-04 - Can't make NH-DTR be LPUNCT no_punct as one might think for
; restrictive relatives (in contrast to non-restrictives which must be

; on the restrictive reading.
; DPF 4-mar-05 - Re 19-Oct-02: This NORM hack interacts badly with the
; appositive rule, where we want to prevent deictic pronouns from appearing,
; and use NORM to block.  Anyway, cf. "That which one writes is admired."
; So try non_number_rel as value instead, including deictics but still
; excluding "here, there".
; DPF 7-may-05 - With the current treatment of punctuation pairing, we need
; two versions of this rule (and similarly for appositives): one which 
; requires the PNCTPR value to match on both daughters, thus satisfying the
; pairing requirements and freeing the PNCTPR value on the mother; and one
; where the left daughter has no punct, so the PNCTPR value propagates.  Same
; for head_adj_scop_phrase.
; DPF 03-Feb-06 - Note that SPR..MIN impl_or_expl_q_rel now generalized to
; i_or_e_quant_or_deg_rel, still blocking construction of bare proper names
; with relative clauses.  FIX - This constraint should only hold for
; restrictive relatives, so when we add non-restrictives, should allow them
; for proper names as well.
; DPF 22-may-06 - Try moving this SPR constraint down to the non-comma variant,
; so we can get non-restrictives like "Abrams, who sings, dances" while still
; blocking the restrictive variant.
; DPF 19-jun-09 - Re 26-Mar-01: This constraint also unfortunately blocks
; "However, XHTML parsed in this way is not ...".  But given the large
; increase in ambiguity for all proper names followed by -ed verbs, and
; the markedness of this construction, leave as is.
; DPF 28-jun-09 - Re 26-Mar-01(b): This RPERIPH constraint should not be on
; this rule, because it blocks all iteration of relative clauses.  Since the
; thatless-rel rule already constrains its MOD..RPERIPH to na_or_-, remove
; it here, and still expect the desired asymmetry where thatless relatives
; must attach to the noun before that-relatives.  But since this constraint
; was also blocking attachment of rel-clauses to bare plural NPs (which are
; RPERIPH +), change n_adj_int_phrase to require MOD..RPERIPH na_or_-, make
; thatless-rels require MOD..RPERIPH -, and full relatives (here) have
; RPERIPH na_or_+.
;; DPF 2012-02-18 - It seems we want to allow relative pronouns to themselves
;; be modified by at least passive VPs, as in |the machine which, properly
;; configured, should last forever|.  So we should append the REL values from

;; comma machinery.  So keep stamp of [REL 0-dlist] on mother for now, and
;; FIX someday.
;; DPF 2012-08-30 - In syntax.tdl, added HD-DTR.INFLECTD + to avoid spurious

;; DPF 2014-10-20 - Re 2012-02-18: Removed the 0-dlist constraint, so we can
;; get |the house which, viewed from above, ...| where the reduced relative is
;; comma-separated.
;; DPF 2015-01-06 - As long as this single type is used both for finite and
;; nonfinite relative clauses, we're stuck with overgenerating as in
;; |*flowers which, which are small, are blue, disappear|, because we want to
;; admire |flowers which, properly admired, grow well, disappear|.  Could
;; split this type for finite/nonfinite, and add [REL 0-dlist] to the head dtr

;; But we still have to have the ordinary modification analysis of PP+PP
;; because in |we were in Paris on Tuesday| the |on Tuesday| does not take
;; |we| as external argument, but rather the state of being in Paris.  So we 
;; end up with a systematic ambiguity for |NP was PP PP|, with one reading 
;; where the semantic index of the subject NP is the external argument of each 
;; of the PPs (|we were in Paris near the Louvre|), and one where the semantic 
;; index of the first PP is the external argument of the second (|we were in 
;; Paris on Tuesday|). 
;; Note that for extraction as in |On Tuesday we were in Paris|, we want the 
;; extracted modification analysis which gives the right semantics, and which 
;; we would not get via this new rule.  Note further that for locative inversion
;; alongside |on the mountain near the top stood a tall tree|, we also want the
;; ordinary modification reading (where the second PP takes the index of the

; DPF (1-May-99) Removed identity of SLASH..KEYREL.LBL and HD-DTR..KEYREL.LBL 
; since 
; this should be redundant for most cases, and is wrong for free relatives
; like "where Kim slept" since in this construction the MIN of the free-rel and
; the MIN of its sister's SLASH must be identified in order to allow "where Kim
; put the book" while blocking "where kim relied".  But this identity means we
; can't have the LBL of that SLASH..MIN be the same as the LBL of the
; head of this extracted-adj phrase, because that would mean that the LBL of
; the ex-adj head's MIN ("slept" in "where she slept" would be wrongly 
; identified with the LBL of the MIN for "where" (which is 'place_rel').
; DPF 2-Oct-01 - Added to mother [SLASH..INDEX.SORT entity] to make this rule
; be complementary to the hd_xaj-tmp_c rule, which is restricted to SORT time.
; DPF 28-Apr-03 - The drawback of this (2-Oct-01) is that it blocks a
; combination of temporal and nontemporal modifiers, as in "why don't we hire
; kim now".
; DPF 13-mar-05 - Tried adding SPR *anti_list* to avoid spurious ambiguity for
; extracted adjuncts of adjective phrases.  Also added POSTHD + to avoid
; spurious extraction from attributive adjectives.
; DPF 28-mar-05 - Added SUBJ *synlist* to distinguish extr_vp from extr_s
; (since MSG no_msg doesn't work for "where is Kim the king", since msg is 
; added (too late) by hd_yesno_c rule).
; DPF 29-apr-07 - Added MOD *anti_list* to prevent [VP [VP [PP/X PP]]] where
; the PP undergoes this rule - while still allowing use of this rule for e.g.
; "Why is Kim in Berlin?". 
; DPF 02-jul-09 - Added HD-DTR..MC na to VP variant, to exclude spurious 
; extraction from filler-head dtr, such as "which arrive".
; DPF 2010-sept-08 - Added SLASH..MIN nondir_or_adv_rel to

; DPF 9-Sept-99 - Changed head-dtr's SPR to be canonical_synsem rather than

; proper noun 'Tuesday' to undergo this rule.
; DPF 17-Mar-01 - Since the choice of bare-np rule is determined by the value
; of DIV on the dtr, this needs to be a strict sort; but a bare-np must
; be able to conjoin with another NP of a different DIV value, so we
; make these not be headed phrases (which identify AGR on mother and head-dtr).
; DPF 6-Apr-01 - Given that we now pump all optional nominal complements, this
; rule now requires the n-bar dtr to also be COMPS < >.
; DPF 22-May-01 - Instead of making mother nonpronominal_synsem (which 
; incorrectly claims all bare NPs are [LEX +]), make mother's MIN nonpro_rel.
; Then make LEX value propagate from dtr to mother.
; DPF 25-Sep-01 - From 17-Mar: Having broken link for AGR of dtr and mother,
; DPF 20-Nov-01 - Moved identification of MODIFD down to the non-proper-name
; subtypes, in order to allow "My friend Mister Abrams" as an appositive.
; DPF 25-Nov-01 - Changed dtr's HEAD from noun to noun_or_nomger to allow e.g.
; "Processing of requests is important"
; DPF 19-Oct-02 - Moved ALTMIN to subtypes, to allow num-nps to differ.
; DPF 28-Nov-02 - HOOK comes only from C-CONT
; DPF 23-oct-03 - Added LPERIPH na_or_+ to dtr to enable blocking of bare-np
; for e.g. "miles an hour" as in "*Kim ran miles an hour".
; DPF 03-dec-03 - But this also blocks "I have time" - not true that the
; candidates for bare-np are same as those for np_adv_c rule.  So undo this
; constraint.  Anyway, above bad example is probably duu to measure-NP that
; should (somehow) be blocked for same reason as "*this string is foot long".
; DPF 14-dec-03 - Removed [ SLASH 0-dlist ] from dtr, since it prevented
; "who did you have pictures of"
; DPF 04-mar-06 - Removed reentrancy of LEX on dtr and mother - need to stamp
; LEX - on mother for hdn_bnp-num_c.  So move down to norm_bare_np.
; DPF 31-mar-08 - Maybe don't want XARG constrained on daughter.  FIX.
; DPF 21-may-09 - Changed mother's SYNSEM from synsem to 
; nonlex_or_lex_phr_synsem so we can distinguish these constructions from
; lexical items.
; DPF 25-may-09 - Added propagation of INFLECTD from dtr to mother, in part
; to block "[Kim and many] gems"
; DPF 26-jun-09 - Re 04-mar-06: Try again to identify LEX on dtr and mother,
; to avoid |US$ 10 billion in revenues| as cmpnd.
;; DPF 2017-05-20 - Detless PP nominals cannot simply identify the HEAD value
;; of mother and dtr, since we want e.g. |at last count| where |last| requires
;; its MOD value to have an explicit quantifier, but we want the mother to be
;; ALTMIN implicit_q_rel.  So remove the identity here, and push down to the
;; other subtypes.
;; DPF 2017-09-05 - Moved identity of PNG on mother and dtr down to subtypes,
;; so the rule for bare predicatives (|Kim is president|) can override the
;; idiosyncratic AGR.PNG 3p constraint on its dtr.
;; DPF 2017-09-12 - Removed identity of C-CONT..XARG and dtr's LTOP, since we
;; now have a bare-NP pumping rule for e.g. |someone who arose| allowing us to
;; attach the post-modifier while the hd-dtr's LTOP is still tied to the main
;; predication's LBL.  This XARG constraint was clashing with use of XARG as
;; index-valued for mal-rule for |?Kim arrives last year|, since having
;; |Saturday| be handle-valued now blocked |Kim arrived Saturday|.  Keep an
;; eye out for other constructions where this [XARG handle] might be used. FIX?
;; DPF 2020-05-09 - Move SPCMPS < > down to subtype, so we can use a non-empty
;; value to prevent detlesspp-NPs from appearing in NP coord structures. Hack,
;; but not clear how else to block.  FIX someday.

;; Non-WH CP subjects, which often alternate with expletive-it subject, where
;; the alternation could be analyzed as it-extraposition.  Here we assume that
;; any predicate with an expletive-it subject and a CP complement also has
;; a subcat without the CP and with an ordinary NP subject.  So we take an
;; ordinary finite VP and convert it via non-branching (syntactic) rule to a 
;; VP that wants a non-WH CP subject and adjusts its semantic linking so it 
;; takes the LTOP of that subject (rather than the INDEX) as its XARG.
;;
;; 'That Kim slept bothers sandy"
;;
;; DPF 22-apr-09 - Re-worked this analysis, so this rule now takes as its
;; dtr a VP/CP looking for an expletive-it subject, and simply discharges
;; the subject, producing an S/CP which is a suitable head for the normal
;; non-WH filler-head construction.  One benefit is that we now also get
;; "That Kim won, we think should be obvious."
;; Another benefit is that we no longer overgenerate anomalous CP subjects
;; as in "That Kim won slept"
;; DPF 2012-10-20 - Added MODIFD lmod to mother to prevent spurious ambig 
;; where a post-hd PP attaches to VP after this rule applies (as well as before)

; Make left member be [ COMPS < > ] to avoid spurious ambiguity since we have
; separate lexical entries to handle optional nominal complements.
; DPF (22-Oct-98) Can't do the above, since it's not true for most nouns, and
; also won't work for "two fifteen meeting" where the am_pm argument is not
; expressed, but can't be discharged by the optcomp rule.

; DPF (4-Mar-99) - Removed the gratuitous some_rel, which was wrong for
; proper name left members of N-N compounds, and also wrong for hour words like
; "a one o'clock meeting" since "one o'clock" already supplied a 
; def_implicit_q_rel of its own.
; Added [ ALTMIN no_rel ] to non-head-dtr to block partitives, deverbal nouns,
; and other unwanted NPs with complex lexical semantics.
; DPF 09-Jan-00 - Also added [ ALTMIN no_rel ] to head-dtr, to block adj-nouns
; from compounds, as in "*Devito five" (ignoring for now "the Jackson five").
; 23-Oct-00 - Dropped NONHD-DTR's [AGR 3sg] constraint in order to allow
; "auto and mortgage loans", as well as "systems analyst" - the constraint is
; not really AGR 3sg, but perhaps something like lexeme vs. inflected word,
; where the lexeme might be conjoined, or even lexically marked as if it were
; plural, but still not [INFLECTD +].
; DPF 18-Aug-01 - Instead of that failed [AGR 3sg] constraint, made the non-hd
; be [INDEX 3sg], since conjoined nominals do not constrain the INDEX value.
; This lets us get 'auto and mortgage loans' while still blocking 'cats hairs'
; 23-Oct-00 - Changed NONHD-DTR's constraint, removing 'pronominal_synsem'
; and instead making the MIN be nonpro_rel, in order to allow conjoined 
; lexical NPs such as "auto and mortgage loans", where the synsem of the phrase
; will not be a subtype of nonpronominal_synsem.
; 17-Nov-00 - Removed 0-dlist specification for head-dtr and mother for
; QUE and REL, since this blocked e.g. "Which state office did he seek"
; DPF 1-Mar-01 - Changed COMPS < > to < > on non-head, now that we are 
; pumping nouns with complements.
; DPF 5-Apr-01 - Moved [LPERIPH -] from here to the noun-noun subtype, to 
; continue to block "towel rusty rack" but allow "1998 annual report".
; DPF 12-mar-05 - Added MODIFD notmod to avoid spurious ambiguity of
; prenom adjective attachment.
; DPF 14-nov-05 - Added MODIFD notmod_or_lmod to nonhd-dtr as well.

; DPF 24-Sept-01 - Made LPERIPH of mother be same as LPERIPH of non-hd, to

; DPF 2-Jul-02 - Go back to making NH-DTR..ALTMIN be no_rel to block
; spurious compound analysis for v-gerund for "hiring Sandy", and let's see
; why we wanted to remove it in the first place.
; DPF 9-Oct-02 - Removed [OPT -] from NH-DTR..VAL.SPR, since it prevented
; compounds like "three pm meeting", and it's not clear what it was needed for.
; DPF 08-May-03 - Identified MODIFD of mother and non-hd-dtr (see 24-Sept-01)
; to preserve notmod or lmod status of the left member (not just the PERIPH
; value).
; DPF 05-Sep-03 - Replaced NH-DTR..ALTMIN no_rel with 
; def_or_udef_q_rel, since no_rel not needed to block verbal gerunds
; anymore, but still want to prevent proper names, while also getting second
; parse for "CSLI department manager".
; DPF 10-dec-03 - But this doesn't block proper names, since their ALTMIN
; only gets specialized to proper_q_rel when made an NP.  So go back to no_rel.
; DPF 10-dec-03 - Made LPERIPH of NHD be bool to exclude possibly spurious 
; analysis for "the ten foot chair".  But this would make the rule not 
; right-recursive, preventing the less likely analysis of "the tobacco garden 
; dog".  So drop constraint on NHD..LPERIPH, and live with the ambiguity.
; DPF 14-dec-03 - Wonder about motivation for 08-May-03 change, since this
; now prevents Adj-N-N from being modified by a PP, as in "big league baseball
; in Pittsburgh".  FIX.
; DPF 29-aug-04 - Re: 08-May-03, but this blocks PP-modification of compounds
; where the non-head happens to be modified, as in "tenth century church in
; Paris".  So return to only identifying the LPERIPH values (see 24-Sept-01),
; and insist that compounds are still notmod
; DPF 22-sept-04 - Changed NH-DTR..SPR *unexpcons* to just *cons* since we
; want e.g. 'nineteenth century farmhouse' where numadj+noun now requires
; the SPR to be expressed to avoid spurious ambiguity for 'five chairs'.
; DPF 09-may-05 - Since we want to constrain appositives to treat indefinites
; separately, we need ALTMIN for nouns to be contentful, reflecting their
; specifier's MIN.  But we still want to exclude proper names (and verbal
; gerunds?), so drop ALTMIN no_rel and instead use MIN nom_nbar_rel.
; DPF 05-oct-05 - Tried adding NORM no_rel to HD-DTR as well, to
; prevent non-compounding nouns from being heads as well as non-heads, as in
; "*the book next" analogous to blocking the unwanted reading for "next book".
; But this alas also blocks det-less noun compounds like 'sea level, where
; we don't want 'level' as left member, but do as head.  So instead make
; type for nouns like 'next' which can't be heads or non-heads.
; DPF 21-jun-07 - Try restricting HD-DTR..MIN to nbar_or_nger_rel, to
; prevent verbal gerunds as heads in compounds, e.g. to avoid spurious parse
; for "[story involving] cats"
; DPF 16-sept-08 - Added HD.DTR..HEAD noun_or_nomger to block spurious 
; analysis for |rule-based|.
; DPF 05-apr-09 - But this also blocks |pea-sized| which we want.  So have to
; live with extra analysis for |rule-based|
; DPF 02-jun-10 - Make NORM quantity_or_no_rel instead of no_rel, to allow 
; for measure nouns.  This no longer gives rise to ambiguity for e.g. 
; |fifty meter ropes| which also had MNP combining with
; head noun via np-hdn_cpd_c rule, because now MNP would have to undergo
; bare-np rule to make NP for compound, but INFLECTD blocks this for bare-nps.
;; DPF 2014-10-20 - Can't make NH-DTR's SPR be *unexplist* as hoped, since it

;; to exclude deictic pronouns as in "that Kim", and further restrict to
;; explicit_q_rel so we can allow nonhead-dtr to include numbers as in
;; "the number five" but not "Abrams five".  This means we'll get as an
;; appositive "my friend Kim" but not "Kim my friend".  It means we also
;; block this analysis for "Lee Browne" - probably right.
;; DPF 12-Sept-01 - Restrict head-dtr to be PRD + to rule out free-relatives
;; DPF 18-Oct-01 - Removed [MODIFD notmod] from HD-DTR, since it blocks
;; 'my old friend kim'
;; DPF 4-Dec-02 - Made AGR..PN be strict_sort on the two dtrs, to exclude
;; as appositives e.g. "Kim and Sandy the book", even though this also rightly
;; will force another analysis to be constructed someday for 
;; "the brothers Grimm".
;; DPF 5-Sep-03 - Changed HD-DTR..ALTMIN from explicit_q_rel to quant_rel
;; to allow proper names which now have ALTMIN proper_q_rel.  Use SORT 
;; unification now to block "Abrams five" while allowing "the number five".
;; DPF 13-Nov-03 - Generalized to allow definite NPs as right dtrs, and
;; prevented recursion by use of LPERIPH.  [NORM no_rel] prevents np_adv's
;; like in "the chair here" or "here the chair"
;; DPF 27-jan-04 - Made MODIFD on non-hd dtr be notmod_or_rmod to prevent 
;; appositive analysis for "Kim interviewed Sandy".
;; But this blocks "my order # 12345", so undo, and instead make the
;; attr_adj_verb lexical rule restrict its MOD.MINORS.MIN value to block the
;; construction of "interviewed Sandy" in the first place, though this may
;; be too strong.
;; DPF 03-may-04 - Changed NHD..MIN from nonpro_rel to nonpro_or_num_rel,
;; to allow "Abrams, number five, arrived".  Still blocking "*Abrams five"
;; because the simple num-noun "five" is LPERIPH na.
;; DPF 16-jun-04 - Removed HD-DTR..LPERIPH bool since it blocks
;; "two people (Kim and Sandy)" since "two people" must be [LPERIPH na].
;; Not sure what overgeneration will result, but we'll see.
;; DPF 16-jul-04 - Added RPERIPH constraints on HD-DTR and mother to block
;; left recursion.
;; DPF 18-jul-04 - Made two subtypes of hdn-np_app-pr_c, one as before for proper
;; names and definite NPs ('Kim the doctor", "my brother Sandy") which allows
;; but does not require separating commas, and the other for indefinites
;; ("Kim, a manager, arrives') where commas are obligatory (to avoid a lot
;; of unwanted ambiguity as in 'We sent Kim a book').
;; DPF 20-aug-04 - Try changing HD-DTR..MIN from reg_nom_rel to
;; nonpro_or_num_rel, to admit "highway 55, the new road"
;; DPF 25-aug-04 - Restrict both dtrs to MSG no_msg, to exclude NPs derived
;; from S's or inf-VPs. 
;; DPF 26-sept-04 - Let's try requiring number agreement for the two dtrs,
;; to rule out spurious analysis for "another two of the chairs".
;; DPF 18-Nov-04 - Removed HD-DTR..PRD -, since this now excludes proper NPs
;; DPF 22-apr-05 - Try ruling out bare plurals as heads, to avoid spurious
;; ambiguity for "we sent two [consultants, Abrams and Browne]"
;; DPF 16-mar-06 - Re 13-Nov-03: Conflict with desire to constrain rel clause
;; rule via NORM.  So removed from NH-DTR, since 'the chair here' is now
;; ruled out by SORT mismatch.
;; DPF 24-may-07 - Tried requiring PNG to match on both dtrs, but this blocked
;; hdn-np_app-pr_c analysis of 'we have two cats, one from each litter'.  
;; Also prevents
;; 'Our team, six men and six women, is going to win', and "Our friends, a
;; couple from Kansas, are visiting."  So remove constraint.
;; DPF 31-may-07 - Changed HD-DTR..MIN from nonpro_or_num_rel to nom_rel,
;; to allow "I myself arrived early" and "we the people"
;; DPF 24-jul-07 - Re 16-mar-06: But we still allow "his home" as 
;; hdn-np_app-pr_c, since
;; pronoun is necessarily unrestricted for SORT.  So instead make the NORM
;; be norm_rel, which will block "home", but allow NPs with rel clauses.
;; DPF 24-apr-09 - Re 13-Nov-03: Changed hd-dtr's NORM from no_rel 
;; to quantity_or_no_rel to allow measure-NPs: |10 mm, the highest measure|, 
;; (note that SPR *olist* (surprisingly) blocks adverbial NPs as heads).
;; DPF 02-jul-09 - Push NH-DTR..NORM norm_rel down to subtypes, to allow
;; parenthetical hdn-np_app-pr_c to admit more variety, as in "the story (what he said)"
;; DPF 11-jan-10 - Removed identification of CASE on two dtrs, since it blocks
;; "John himself arose."  Can't remember what it was added to avoid ...
;; DPF 18-jul-2010 - Re 24-jul-07: Changed HD-DTR..NORM quantity_or_no_rel
;; to quantity_or_norm_or_no_rel, since this was blocking as heads any NPs 
;; which don't appear as left members of noun-noun compounds (these are NORM 
;; norm_rel), and because we now block appos of e.g. |his home| with distinct 
;; NORM values. New value still blocks demonstratives, as in |that Browne|.
;; DPF 2012-12-20 - Changed HD-DTR..LPUNCT from no_punct to dq_or_no_punct
;; since we want |we admire "Scores Plus," the film.|
;; DPF 2013-01-09 - Removed RPERIPH na on mother and RPERIPH bool on NH-DTR,
;; to allow appos in coord, such as [[Kim, the cat,] and Abrams].
;; DPF 2014-08-21 - Further extended HD-DTR..LPUNCT to allow left parens,
;; since we want |my uncle (Kim Browne, the author)|
;; DPF 2015-03-27 - Added PT notpro_or_refl to non-head dtr, to prevent unwanted
;; anaphor substitution when paraphrasing, while still allowing |Kim herself|
;; DPF 2016-01-27 - Added MINORS.NORM norm_rel to prevent appositives from
;; being vocatives, to avoid mostly spurious ambiguity, as in 
;; |the pronoun "you" sleep|. FIX better someday?
;; DPF 2016-08-06 - Re DPF 13-Nov-03: Let's keep LPERIPH na since this
;; prevents appositive |Monday the first| from undergoing npadv rule as in
;; |we arrrived Monday the first|, so we only get the preferred n-mod analysis.
;; DPF 2018-03-29 - Removed --BARE from HD-DTR: push into educ subtypes.
;; DPF 2019-09-12 - Re 2016-01-27: Generalize norm_rel to quantity_or_norm_rel,
;; so we can also allow measure phrases as heads, as in |$200, my total, rises.|
;; DPF 2019-10-31 - Re 2018-03-29: But we want to avoid detless-NPs as heads of

;; Adverbial-NP modifiers
;;

; DPF 11-Jun-99 - Added SUBJ..OPT - to prevent these temporal NPs from filling
; ordinary NP argument positions.
;
; DPF 26-Jul-99 - Changed [HEAD noun] to [HEAD prep] to avoid double parse
; for "Thursday the fourth" where "the fourth" attaches after "Thursday"
; is itself an npadv_mod phrase.
; DPF 9-Sept-99 - Added PRD - to mother, to block temp-mods as complements of
; copula.
; DPF 30-Sept-99 - But this blocks all post-nominal modification with temporal
; NPs, sigh.  Besides, the most natural reading of "The meeting is Tuesday" is
; with the temp-mod reading rather than the identity one.
; DPF 2-Sept-00 - Removed SPR, to avoid spurious analysis for "my mornings 
; look pretty booked tuesdays".  Don't recall why we wanted a SPR on these
; phrases.
; DPF 4-Apr-01 - Added PRD from dtr to prevent e.g. relpro "that" from being 
; the complement of copula, as in "the book that Kim is", while allowing "here
; are the books", which requires npadv_mod extraction from locative inversion.
; DPF 17-Jul-01 - Replaced SPR, since we want "leave right now", where the 
; nominal "now" gets pumped to a modifier, and can (only) then take a degree 
; specifier.  It seems the ambiguity of 2-Sept-00 is not spurious, just
; unlikely.
; DPF 25-Sep-01 - Added reentrancy of AGR and SUBJ's INDEX, to get no-copula
; constructions like "Kim in Berlin becoming impatient"
; DPF 2-Apr-02 - Made SUBJ be expressed_synsem rather than synsem, to prevent
; these phrases from appearing as complements of when_subord_prd.
; DPF 30-May-02 - But this also blocks "someone there".  So remove this
; constraint, and instead restrict the when_subord_prd complement to be
; non-temporal.
; DPF 9-May-02 - Identified INDEX.SORT of dtr and of mother, to avoid letting
; temporal NPs be fillers for ordinary adjunct extraction, which was giving
; us a spurious parse for e.g. "when did kim arrive"
; DPF 28-Nov-02 - HOOK comes only from C-CONT
; DPF 2-May-03 - Try replacing dtr's [MODIFD hasmod] with [MODIFD lmod] to
; block "*KIm fell time that I did" but allow "Kim fell two times".  This
; seems to force us to have two lexical entries for "the", one which is notmod
; (as is its head sister), and one for modified nominals, where "the" stamps
; [MODIFD lmod] whether the nominal is right-modified or left-modified, so
; we still get "Kim arrived the week Sandy left".
; DPF 13-May-02 - Added SLASH <! !> to prevent spurious ambiguity for "Kim
; arrived when(ever) Sandy left". 
; DPF 27-May-03 - Re 2-May-03: But those two "the" entries have the effect of
; preventing us from using the intersective modification efficiency improvement
; for generation, since "the consultant" uses a different "the" than "the tall
; consultant", which means the generator's second-pass adjunction algorithm
; will fail to enrich "the consultant" to "the tall consultant".  Since that
; two-pass strategy depends on the phrase without modifiers being the "same"
; as the phrase with modifiers (at least using the same lexical entries), it
; seems to drive us back to just one entry for "the" which preserves the
; MODIFD value of its SPEC.  And then this rule requires that its dtr go back
; to just [MODIFD hasmod].  Not too troubling for this particular case, since
; the above example with "time" was playing on an ambiguity between the count
; and the mass senses, which we are treating as underspecification, perhaps
; wrongly.
; DPF 06-Jun-03 - Changed the identity of SORT on dtr and mother's INDEX, since
; this excluded temporal modifiers of non-temporal nouns ("meetings Tuesday"),
; and seemed counter-intuitive.  Rather we want the SORT of the dtr to 
; constrain the ARG0 of the derived "PP" itself (its E-INDEX), not what the PP 
; modifies.
; DPF 09-Jun-03 - Made dtr be MODIFD.LPERIPH bool to exclude "Kim arrived
; times I left"
; DPF 22-Jul-03 - Might think to make SPR's MIN be much_deg_rel rather than 
; simply degree_rel to avoid spurious ambig for "right now", given two entries
; "right" for 'very' and 'much' type degree specifiers.  But this blocks "too
; late" where "too" is not much-deg subtype.  
; DPF 16-oct-03 - Changed LPERIPH from bool to na_or_+ to be consistent with
; revised treatment of number adjectives
; DPF 30-oct-03 - Mysteriously, MOD was not restricted to non-empty SPR, which
; meant spurious parses attaching to both Nbar and NP (and VP and S).  Changed,
; but how unnoticed till now?  Also, --SIND on SUBJ was not co-indexed. Fixed
; DPF 01-may-04 - Continuing the pendulum swing of 2-Sept-00 and 17-Jul-01,
; removed SPR again, since we get "right now" as an NP, and have just added
; an analysis for "too late" and "too long" where these gradable NPs take
; "too", "very", etc. before pumping to PP.
; DPF 25-sept-04 - Removed SYNSEM..MOD..MSG no_msg, since we want to allow
; e.g. 'tomorrow, can you come' using adj_i_ques rule.  Rather, make MSG
; value same as that of MOD, like ordinary prepositions.
; DPF 12-nov-05 - Added MOD..NORM norm_rel to prevent these from 
; modifying lexical NP-adverbials as in e.g. "here there"
; DPF 05-dec-05 - Re: 25-sep-01 - Not clear what that comment meant, but
; removed AGR reentrancy since this was preventing e.g. "Here lies Kim"
; where the AGR ends up not being of type 'index'
; DPF 30-sept-06 - Re: 12-nov-05: But this interferes in interaction with
; appositives, as in "the manager today, Abrams, arrives."  So instead use
; value 'non_number_rel', which also allows 'no_rel', only excluding
; 'never_unify_rel'.
; DPF 23-may-07 - Re: 01-may-04, we want "they know why Kim is here", and
; "why" wants to modify a phrase with a non-empty SPR, so modnp "here"
; needs such a SPR, but we'll make it anti_synsem_min to avoid unwanted
; side-effects.
; DPF 18-jun-07 - Re 30-sept-06: But if we block "here there", we also
; block "here today" as in "Kim is here today", and also "Kim arrives late
; this afternoon."  So remove this constraint, and live with the spurious
; analysis of "here there".
; DPF 02-jul-09 - Constrain dtr to INDEX nonconj_ref-ind to avoid spurious
; ambiguity for "Kim arrives Tuesday and Wednesday"
; DPF 04-sept-09 - Removed reentrancy of MODIFD on mother and dtr, since
; we want to allow "Yesterday, Kim was here", where the np_adv_c must undergo
; hd_xaj-int-vp_c rule, which constrains its dtr to be notmod (to avoid
; spurious ambiguity).  See what trouble this removed constraint might give...
; DPF 13-mar-10 - Re 02-jul-90: Unfortunately, this also blocks "every 
; morning and evening", so undo this change, and live with ambiguity for
; "Tuesday and Wednesday".
; DPF 20-mar-10 - Re 23-may-07: Given that degree specifiers cannot combine
; directly either with cardinal adjectives or with meas-NPs (in both cases
; to avoid spurious ambiguity elsewhere), we need to allow adverbial
; meas-NPs to take specifiers, as in "Kim slept just over twelve hours."
; So push down to subtypes.
;; DPF 2011-08-02 - Re 16-oct-03: Changed to LPERIPH +, to exclude e.g.
;; |We arrived March the third month|, where appositives are necessarily
;; [LPERIPH na].
;; DPF 2011-10-21 - Removed REL 0-dlist from mother, since it blocks e.g.
;; |companies whose ads this year were longer prospered|
;; DPF 2015-03-11 - Changed parent type from basic_unary_phrase to
;; norm_unary_phrase in order to get the delimiter properties to propagate
;; from dtr to mother, and also PUNCT, to avoid leaving RPUNCT unbound in
;; spurious analysis of |when did Kim arise?|
;; DPF 2015-08-17 - Was tempted to add no_aspect to event of mother's EP, in
;; order to facilitate generation, but this is clearly wrong for predicative
;; uses, as in |the meeting was Tuesday| with pred copula.  So undo, and
;; reconsider how to enable generation when input MRS may arrive with overt
;; no_aspect constraint on that ARG0.

; analysis for 'ten foot rope' (in addition to intended NP-N compound).
; DPF 25-may-09 - Leave SPR on mother unconstrained here, and in subtypes,
; either stamp < anti_synsem > or in normal binary rule, pass up from left
; dtr, to enable "the hundred mile road" but block

;; DPF 2012-09-18 - Moved DTR1.SYNSEM basic_lex_synsem down to bare-mnp,

;; DPF 2018-03-12 - Added LPERIPH na_or_+ to block spurious adj-adjn analysis

;; DPF 2020-04-18 - Change mother's SPEC from < > to < anti_synsem_min > so
;; we can get |the five cent a gallon tax| where |five cent| is a spr of

;; |$2 a gallon|, so it needs a non-empty SPEC value.
;; DPF 2020-04-21 - The 2020-04-18 change required corresponding change for

;; DPF 12-08-03 - Re: 12-03-01 - The udef quantifier should come either
;; from the meas_np_degadv rule or from the bare_np rule, so not from here.
;; We force the bare-meas phrase to under the bare_np rule by making the

; DPF 12-Apr-03 - Added CARDINAL + to DTR2 to block e.g. 'first day' as meas-NP
; DPF 27-jul-04 - Removed DTR2..SPR *olist* to get 'the million dollar view'
; DPF 20-aug-04 - Removed MODIFD notmod, since this prevents "ten miles east"
; from being an np_adv_c, since the sp-hd_n_c rule takes its MODIFD value from 
; the non-hd dtr.  Don't know what this constraint was ruling out - we'll see.
; DPF 19-nov-04 - Considered making mother be MODIFD lmod, in order to avoid 
; seemingly spurious ; attachment of posthead modifiers to measure-NP, as in 
; "ten dollars that Kim hired".  (The current analysis of "ten miles east" has 
; "ten miles" as a specifier of "east".)  But this constraint would block e.g.
; "ten miles on artificial snow is hard work", so we live with the ambiguity.
; DPF 24-may-10 - (Re 27-jul-04) Again tried removing DTR2..SPR *olist* since 
; we want "the million dollar house".  Assume the mnp-deg-spec rule will 
; ensure that we block "*the mountain is thousand meters high" while allowing 
; "the thousand-meter high mountain".
;; DPF 2012-04-09 - Re 24-may-10, note that we keep putting this *olist* back.
;; If remove it, then need to change bare-np rule to require its dtr's SPR
;; list to have REST be *olist*.
;; DPF 2012-09-12 - Re 20-aug-04 and 19-nov-04: It is clear that we want to
;; allow rightward modification, as in |ten miles on snow is fun|, so we
;; can't stamp MODIFD lmod on mother; and also clear that we can't stamp
;; MODIFD notmod on mother, since we want |ten miles east| to be able to be
;; np_adv.  But we also want to block spurious adj_adjn for |big ten feet|
;; so let's try MODIFD.LPERIPH + on mother.
;; DPF 2012-09-28 - But LPERIPH + also blocks N-N compounds where the meas-NP
;; is in the head-dtr, as in |benchmark 10% rate|, and anyway the npadv_mnp
;; rule does not mind its dtr with MODIFD notmod, so we go back to notmod.
;; DPF 2017-07-06 - We can't propagate CASE from noun dtr to mother, since
;; we're using [CASE no_case] on some meas nouns to prevent them as bare NP
;; modifiers as in |*the market rose dollars|.  We'll see what that identity
;; was intended to do.  FIX??
;; DPF 2017-09-15 - To avoid spurious ambiguity with nbar-coord for
;; |two-year and three-year notes|, make the LEX value the same as that of DTR1
;; Also, push [PN 3s] down to the subtype for |ten foot|, leaving it underspec
;; for |$10 million|, so we can allow |$10 million were invested|.
;; DPF 2020-04-16 - Removed identity of COMPS on mother and DTR2 (normally
;; empty), since the value of COMPS is now constrained in subtypes.
;; DPF 2020-05-16 - The reason for appending the SPR of the adj dtr to the 
;; mother's SPR seems to be to block |hundred years elapsed|, but having it 
;; prevents analysis of |the past hundred years|.  Instead, since bare-NP rule
;; requires dtr to be RPERIPH +, we propagate RPERIPH from adj dtr, and have
;; |hundred| etc be RPERIPH -.  But still need to have mother's SPR.REST be
;; compatible with *unexpcons* so these can undergo mnp_deg_adv rule which
;; has additional constraints on its dtr.

; DPF 12-Mar-99 - Can't simply identify HEAD of HD-DTR with SLASH..HEAD of 
; NH-DTR, since these two HEAD values themselves include MOD, which 
; includes SUBJ values, which include CONT, and since the free relative
; combines with an S (not a VP), that SUBJ.CONT of the S/NP is now identified
; with the semantics of the S/NP's subject, but now it's not possible to
; use the free_rel phrase as a VP modifier, because it will eventually want to
; unify that same MOD.SUBJ.CONT with that of the subject of the VP that the
; free_rel modifies, but the RELS value of that attribute is already bound to 
; the earlier subject's RELS.
;   So we have each free-rel lexical entry specify the relevant constraints on
; the SLASH of its sister in this construction.
;   The QUE value of the free relatives is a singleton list containing an index
; instead of a handle - this distinguishes free relatives from question words,
; and makes available this index for interpretation at the ltop of the phrase,
; which may be desirable if there is indeed ambiguity in the meaning of
; examples like "I'll interview whoever's frog wins this race."  (We're not
; doing anything with that index just now, beyond checking for its presence.)
; DPF (1-May-99) Removed identification of HD-DTR..MIN and NHD-DTR..SLASH..MIN
; since the slash's MIN is already identified with the main verb's MIN in the
; non-head dtr, for independent reasons.  Don't know what work this was 
; supposed to do, anyway.

; DPF 10-Jun-99 - Added SUBJ *olist* to head-dtr, to prevent e.g. "one to three".

; DPF 15-feb-10 - Might consider generalizing the punctuation marker to 
; allow opening single and double quotes, as well as explicit italics marker
; (replacing lital_punct with dq_or_sq_or_lital_punct), but at present we
; already get a N-N compound analysis for sequences of unknown words, so an
; additional FW analysis is not obviously useful.
;; DPF 2012-02-18 - We want double quoted phrases to be analyzable here,
;; since some are quoted sequences of ordinary English words, as in 
;; |"Can't wait" is a familiar phrase.|
;; DPF 2016-09-12 - Restricted left dtr's RPUNCT from pair_or_no_punct to
;; just no_punct, to exclude pair_punct, since this was allowing us to zoom 
;; past the end of an italicized sequence without terminating.  Likewise
;; for right dtr's RPUNCT.
;; DPF 2017-10-29 - Changed INFLECTD na to na_or_+ on left dtr, since this one 
;; can be either a word or a fw-sequence.
;; DPF 2017-11-02 - Made right dtr be INFLECTD na, since this can now only be
;; the generic_quoted entry introduced by token mapping (foreign_token_tmr)
;; for each cell in the chart.
;; DPF 2020-05-12 - It would seem that we want to constrain the right dtr to
;; exclude double-quote punct, to force termination on the right of a quoted
;; phrase.

;; DPF 2016-09-12 - Added RPUNCT..IGNOREQ - to left dtr so we don't overrun the
;; right boundary of a foreign-word sequence where we've ignored the closing
;; right ital or quote.  Also changed right dtr's INFLECTD from + to na_or_+, 
;; since the right-ital rule imposes INFLECTD na.  Also added SPEC < > to mother
;; to prevent these from undergoing the vocative NP rule.  Also added 
;; MODIFD notmod to prevent these from undergoing the npadv rule.
;; DPF 2017-01-31 - Surprised that the right dtr's RPUNCT was
;; comma_or_clause_or_pair_punct, so changed it to dq_or_sq_or_rital_punct.
;; But we also have to allow for comma or clause punct following the quote
;; marks, as in |the verb "to be".| so the comma/clause punct would hide the 
;; presence of the closing right quotes, blocking the fw-seq rule.  Hence added
;; another feature RITAL to the RCLSTR group, and have the three right-punct 
;; rules for quotes and italics set the value of this feature to +.  Then just
;; preserve the RPUNCT value from dtr to mother, and set mother's RITAL to -.
;; DPF 2018-05-31 - Added HD-DTR..LPERIPH - to block these with pre-title.
;; DPF 2019-11-18 - Changed mother's ALTMIN from explicit_q_rel to proper_q_rel,
;; to admit NP-N compounds as in |the "admire Kim" group arrived|.
;; DPF 2019-11-28 - Re 2019-11-18: But we also want |the "id est"| so generalize

; Verbal gerund N-bars: 'hiring Kim' is important.
; DPF 23-jun-09 - Try restricting dtr to phr_synsem, to avoid spurious
; ambiguity with nominal gerund for simple intransitives, e.g. "arriving"
; DPF 28-jun-09 - Add RPERIPH + to prevent spurious ambiguity of post-modif.
; DPF 28-jan-10 - Generalized SUBJ..HEAD from noun to basic_noun, to allow
; partitive subjects, as in "none hiring Kim"
;; DPF 2010-10-24 - Discovered that we cannot identify the SPR..INDEX with
;; the SUBJ..INDEX (and thus the XARG of the dtr), since the spr's index
;; is already going to be identified with the INDEX of the nominalized
;; phrase, which is certainly not the ARG1 of the dtr.  Instead, it's the
;; XARG of the possessive which presents the pronoun's index that we want.
;; DPF 2013-09-26 - Removed PRD - since this prevented both |my hiring Kim|
;; and |me hiring Kim|.  We'll see what work it was doing.
;; DPF 2017-04-02 - Rextrict dtr to MC na_or_- to enable blocking of spurious

;; Coordinate structures
;;
;   We set the MIN of the mother to be that of the right-hand daughter, rather
; arbitrarily, but the MIN needs to be set, since many lexical types select
; an argument based on the MIN value.
;   We also need to set the type of the index on the mother, to match the types
; of the indices on the daughters.  It looks like this will force us to make 
; the kind of index a feature, not just a type, but for now we wrongly make the
; index be that of the right-hand daughter.  This does not break subject-verb
; agreement for plural NPs, since we only change INDEX in this hack, not AGR.
;   And we have to make sure that the BODY attributes of two conjoined 
; quantified phrases are identified, but not clear how to do this.
; DPF (27-Apr-99) Both conjuncts have MIN constrained to independent_rel, since
; they may be relations underspecified for use as particles - by doing this, we
; exclude coordination of particles themselves, but this is probably okay.
; DPF (1-May-99) At present we overgenerate with conjoined propositions because
; we cannot identify the MSG values of the two conjuncts - that would wrongly
; make the MARG values of those two messages be identified. Hence we accept eg.
; "*I wonder who left and that Sandy arrived".  As long as MSG values are
; typed relations, there doesn't seem to be a way out of this awkwardness.
; DPF (1-May-99) In the long run, we cannot simply identify the whole local 
; values of SLASH for the two conjuncts, since this would mean that the handles
; of the two extracted elements would be wrongly identified - wrong at least 
; for ordinary complements, which identify their LTOP handle with that of their
; head, meaning that in "the book Kim saw and Sandy liked" the handles for 
; "saw" and "liked" would be identified, which is bad since these handles each 
; fill a MARG role in distinct messages.  
; DPF 20-Nov-99 - Made all coord_phr's be LEX - in order to avoid, among other
; things, coordinate structures as right members of noun-noun compounds, as in
; 'the seventeenth, twentieth, or twenty-third'.
; DPF 20-Jun-00 - Made LEX match on both conjuncts, to avoid e.g. "Kim [ had
; Sandy and would ] arise" (with causative "have")  
; DPF 28-Aug-00 - But this will block "Kim and the cat arrived", so removed it.
; DPF 3-Feb-01 - Moved [ CONJ complex-conj ] on right dtr to subtypes, in order
; to let us treat run-on sentences as coordination.
; DPF 22-Mar-01 - Moved AGR.DIV reentrancy down to NP coordination, since
; want to allow non-like AGR.DIV values for sentence coordination, as in
; "I arrived and consultants left."
; DPF 29-may-07 - Changed constraint on RCONJ-DTR to be [LEX bool] rather
; than nonlex_synsem, so we can allow "etc," as right dtr.  Conjunction words
; are now [LEX na].
; DPF 25-jun-09 - Can't recall why mother's SLASH.LIST is *arglist*, excluding
; extracted modifiers.  This blocks "In paris, we hire him with abrams or 
; browne."  FIX
; DPF 27-jul-09 - Block |an| in AP coord: "tall and an understanding arrived"
; Also remove nonloc identif from basic_coord_phr.
; DPF 2011-04-26 - Re 25-jun-09: This constraint also blocks "during which
; Kim arrived and Abrams arose".  But it is well-motivated: there is no good
; way to construct a semantics for an extracted modifier across-the-board, 
; since the modifier has to take its modifiee's INDEX event as its ARG1, and 
; for a coordinated phrase, that has to be the conjoined index, not the 
; (spurious) unification of the two individual events.  So will have to 
; allow for an extracted adjunct from a conjoined S (likely a new rule).
; For related fix to 25-jun-09 ex., see 2011-05-01 change to head_adj_phrase.

;; DPF 22-Dec-98 - Modified filler_head_rule_non_wh to require head to be 
;; VFORM fin, in order to block "*Kim hire".  The VFORM used to be fin_or_imp,
;; to allow an extraction analysis of "On Monday hire Kim", but this also
;; allowed a spurious second analysis for "On Monday tell Kim that Sandy left".
;; So a new construction for left dislocation is needed for "On Monday hire Kim",
;; one which would also admit "As for that book, who did it offend?" where a
;; (double) extraction analysis would otherwise be required.

;; DPF 29-Jan-99 - Constrained nonhead_dtr to be HEAD n_or_p, in order to block
;; Yoda examples like "Happy you will be" or "Making a mess you are".  More
;; generally these should simply be dispreferred, but we'll block them for now.
;
; DPF 10-Jun-99 - Note that filler_head_rule_non_wh does not currently inherit 
; from non_rel_clause, but perhaps should.
; 
; DPF 10-Jun-99 - Removed mc_fillhead_phrase from filler_head_rule_non_wh since
; topicalized constructions can be embedded, as in "Kim thinks on Tuesday we
; should be in Berlin"
; -- DPF 24-Mar-01 - But this is too weak: we still need to block "*I'm sure 
; bananas he likes" - cf. examples with "bet".  So put back mc_fillhead_phrase,
; and wait for more inspiration about allowing S-init adjuncts for embedded S's
; DPF 2-Feb-01 - Generalized HEAD value of nonhead_dtr to include adverbs as
; well as n_or_p, to get "Quietly kim left"
; DPF 2-Apr-01 - Removed INV - from head-dtr to allow "here are my questions"
; DPF 13-May-01 - Added [HD-DTR..MODIFD notmod_or_rmod] to prevent root
; exclamatives like "oh" from modifying the head of the head-filler.
; DPF 25-Sep-01 - From 2-Apr-01: But this overgenerates too much, so putting
; it back in (cf "*There is Kim Sandy")
; DPF 12-Apr-02 - Apparently INV - was put back on head-dtr (see 2-Apr-01) --
; this blocks non-wh PP-fronting for yes-no questions, as in "On Tuesday did
; Kim arrive".  Maybe right not to treat these as unbounded dependencies -
; note lack of ambiguity for "tomorrow can you ask Sandy to call me?"
; DPF 1-Jun-02 -Added HD-DTR..MSG.PRED prop-or-ques_m_rel to exclude imperatives
; since sometime between 22-Dec-98 and now (see above) the VFORM constraint was
; removed, but we still want to block "*kim hire".
; DPF 13-Oct-03 - But blocking "Kim hire" also prevents us from getting PPs
; fronted for imperatives, as with "On Sunday, buy two books".  It also blocks
; "Books about elephants, buy only on Sundays" which seems fine.  So removed
; this constraint, and expect punctuation to catch "*Kim hire" since we want
; a comma after fronted phrase for imperatives.
; DPF 26-Nov-03 - Further constrained head-dtr's MODIFD (see 13-May-01) to
; exclude rmod, to avoid spurious parse for "Kim we hired, singing".
; DPF 21-aug-04 - Try relaxing hd-dtr's MODIFD value to notmod_or_lmod, to
; allow e.g. "on Tuesday, if you wish, leave early"
; DPF 27-aug-04 - Removed parent mc_fillhead_phrase to allow these as
; subordinate clauses, as in "since on Tuesday they'll leave"
; DPF 8-apr-05 - Removed NH-DTR..MSG no_msg to get "Kim arrived, Abrams said."
; DPF 05-sept-05 - Tried making NH-DTR..RPUNCT include clause_punct, to
; allow "Who arrived? asked Kim."  But this means unwanted overgeneration
; like "Kim. we hired" and "Kim? we hired".  So we'll have to find another
; analysis for this stripped down clause-fronting - note that if the 
; fronted sentence is quoted, all is well with the existing pair_punct
; constraint on the non-hd dtr.
; DPF 9-oct-05 - The nonhd-dtr was marked [CASE non_obliq] as a hack to
; prevent lexical PPs from fronting (see 25-mar-05 in lextypes.tdl)
; but this prevents us from getting "Here Kim slept" now that we want "here" 
; to be [CASE obliq] in order to prevent these as direct objects as in "here 
; kim plunged into the lake". So we'll look for another way to block the
; unwanted parse for "on the first kim arrived" if indeed we should.
; DPF 23-nov-06 - Re: 27-aug-04: Restored MC + since we now distinguish two
; types of subordinating preps, one class like "since" which allow topicalized
; complement S, and the other class like "after" which don't.
;; DPF 21-mar-10 - Added CASE non-obliq to prevent these from appearing e.g.
;; as complements of subordinating conjunctions that don't want them.
;; DPF 2010-10-23 - FIX: We're wrongly asserting here that embedded non-wh
;; filler-head constructions cannot have bse-form verb, thus blocking
;; |we demanded that on Monday he be released|.  But we would have to 
;; add main-clause and non-mc variants of this rule, which is already split
;; with respect to comma-marked filler.  So undergenerate for now.
;; DPF 2011-08-07 - Re: 21-aug-04: removing HD-DTR.MODIFD notmod_or_lmod,
;; now that we propagate value in subj-head phrase, since we still want
;; extraction from VP modifying PP: "that office, the consultants work in.'
;; DPF 2012-02-12 - Can't see why the mother wasn't REL 0-dlist, but the lack
;; meant we get the phrase |I feel like a little kid| as the filler in the
;; fillhead_rel rule.  Corrected.
;; DPF 2016-02-26 - We can't identify RPUNCT.PSF with INDEX.SF on hd-dtr,
;; because when this filler-head phrase is a complement, we can get a clash with
;; what the higher verb wants as in the imperative
;; |note that in Paris we arise.|  
;; So undo this link, and FIX eventually, maybe by introducing non-branching
;; root rule(s).
;; DPF 2020-08-14 - Re 2016-02-26: In general, we need this identity, to avoid
;; generating "Yesterday, we arose?" from "Yesterday, we arose."  So split each
;; instance of this rule into MC +/- where the main clause one does identity.

; must itself have some property incompatible with the complement of 'wonder',
; but not a HEAD property since the head-filler phrase used for 'wonder who

;; DPF 2016-09-05 - Re 2014-07-22: To be more precise, the do-be analysis needs
;; the XARG of the NP |the thing we did| to be the index of the subject of the

;; complement's XARG, to get the control right for who does the winning in
;; |the thing we did was win|.  That XARG of the NP thus has to be passed up
;; even through clausal boundaries: |the thing she thought we did was win|. So
;; we identify the XARG of that `do' with its SLASH's XARG, and then at the top
;; of the relative clause, identify the SLASH..XARG with the REL..XARG and with
;; the MOD..XARG, so it gets identified with the head noun's XARG.
;;   The problem with |my couch on which we sat arrived| is that the XARG of
;; the SLASH in |on which we sat| is the normal XARG of the PP |on which|, 
;; namely the event INDEX of the VP it is modifying.  So identifying that XARG
;; with the noun's XARG leads to a clash when there is a possessive determiner,
;; because our analysis of possessive idioms needs to expose the possessor
;; INDEX, which is of course a ref-ind, not an event.
;;   Fortunately, the do-be construction does not allow pied-piping relative
;; clauses, so we can split the each of the finite and nonfinite 
;; filler-head-relative rules into two rules, one for NP fillers, where the 
;; SLASH..XARG is identified with MOD..XARG, and one for PP fillers, where 
;; this identification is not made.
;; DPF 2016-10-22 - Re 2014-10-20: Alas, this ppair constraint prevents
;; |cat which, though happy, jumped| because the rule requires the filler to
;; have a non-robust comma (if any).  However, we really want the structure to

; Require RCONJ-DTR..LPUNCT comma_punct to rule out "Kim arose arrived and
; laughed" but allow both "Kim arose, arrived and laughed" and also
; "Kim arose, arrived, and laughed"  This assumes that conj_words do not 
; lexically constrain LPUNCT, unlike most words.  So in the base case (the
; first time this rule applies in a series of mid-conj's), the left dtr is
; optionally marked with a comma (RPUNCT comma_or_no_punct), but since the
; mother is [LPUNCT no_punct, RPUNCT comma_punct], the only way this rule
; can reapply is if the phrase picks up a left comma in order to match the
; requirement on the right dtr's LPUNCT.  (This arrangement looks like it
; would in principle accept a double comma on the left dtr in a recursively
; applied structure, as in "Abrams, Browne,, Chiang, and Devito", but the
; preprocessor doesn't admit the two successive commas, so we can live with
; this flaw for now.)

; on the final conjunct: [arise [, smile [, [and [ go .]]]]].  FIX?? later.

; DPF 10-may-05 - Use new feature PUNCT.PAIRED to enable constraint on presence
; of commas in three (or more) part coordination, ensuring that if the 
; next-to-last conjunct is comma-marked, all leftward conjuncts are too,
; while if the next-to-last conjunct is not comma-marked, the next one
; doesn't have to be either, but can be.  The way it works is that the 
; affixation rule for comma punctuation stamps [PAIRED no-ppair], while
; a non-punctuated sign is underspecified for PAIRED.  This mid_coord_rule 
; type propagates that PAIRED property up from its left dtr, so it's still 
; visible on the mid-coordinated phrase.  Then the top_coord_rule requires 
; that its left dtr unifies its PUNCT.PNCTPR value with the PAIRED value of 
; its right dtr.  The effect is that if the next-to-last conjunct is unmarked, 
; it will not restrict the PNCTPR value of the top conjunct, but if the 
; next-to-last is comma-marked, it imposes a constraint (eventually) on the 
; top conjunct's PNCTPR value, forcing it to be a comma.

;; DPF 2018-05-21 - The above constraint was propagating more than desired, 
;; as in |Here, we arrived as a way to sing and dance.| where the

;; and dance| as a complement rather than as a relative clause, the NP |a way 
;; to sing and dance| will also be SLASH.LIST *arglist*, and the same for the

;; adjunct extraction (which makes the resulting SLASH.LIST be *modcons*), 
;; since the SLASH values of the two dtrs in the hd-adj rule are appended and

; LBLs with those of their complements unless they are 'scopal' heads),

; two-argument verbs (transitive, subj-equi, etc.)
;; DPF 2020-04-10 - Pushed mother's HEAD verb down to subtypes, because we

;; DPF 2019-09-10 - Re 2018-04-03: Since ordinary adj always has a non-empty

; Exclude proper name nbar coord for now at least.
; DPF 26-aug-04 - Generalized dtrs' HEAD from noun to noun_or_nomger
; DPF 25-feb-05 - Added unif of NORM on mother and dtrs to preserve
; non-compoundability as in "*[paper and other] garbage"
; DPF 13-mar-05 - Added MODIFD notmod to mother, to capture apparent and
; interesting fact that coordination of nbars results in a phrase that can 
; again take either a posthead or prehead modifier: '[cats and small dogs] 
; in Paris' and 'small [cats in boxes and large dogs]'.
; DPF 2-apr-05 - But this addition overconstrains the rule, disallowing e.g.
; 'the tenth and eleventh I am out of town'.  So leave underspecified.
; DPF 14-nov-05 - Removed identification of LEX on dtrs and mother, since
; want to coordinate e.g. "garden with dogs and flower garden".  This could
; raise nice puzzle, since want to allow "flower and vegetable garden"
; but block "*flower and vegetable with leaves garden".  Happily, making
; non-head in compounds be non-inflected blocks the latter, since head-mod
; rule (for "vegetable with leaves" requires inflected dtrs).  So for now
; identify LEX of mother with right dtr - maybe unnecessary. FIX?  But to
; avoid too much ambiguity, for now still require #lex identity for 
; mid-coord rule.
; DPF 14-nov-05 - Re 2-apr-05: The adj_adjh rule needs to have some MODIFD
; value for its modifiee, so leaving value unconstrained is unsatisfactory.
; Here try propagating the value from the left dtr, arbitrarily.
; DPF 13-mar-10 - Constrain the conjoined phrase to have same spr's MIN
; value, to block e.g. [[every cat] and dog] where adj `every' requires 
; explicit determiner.
;; DPF 2018-02-13 - We can't require the SPRs on the dtrs to be SLASH 0-dlist
;; since free relative "whatever" has SLASH non-empty, as in |whatever cats
;; and dogs we admire|
;; DPF 2020-05-16 - Change mother's SPR to append the rest of left dtr's SPR,
;; so when we coordinate two measure-NPs, the result preserves the distinctive
;; property that allows measnp-deg-adv, namely a non-empty rest of SPR, as in
;; |[one meter or two meters] tall|

;; DPF 2011-09-02 - Since the coordination of two mass nouns can still show

;; DPF 2012-12-17 - Removed INFLECTD + constraints on dtrs, since we also
;; need this rule for |the rice and corn cat arises|
;; DPF 2013-05-10 - Re 2011-09-02: But only get singular agreement if both
;; conjuncts are mass; otherwise have to use the conjunction's CAGR value:
;; |*cats and rice arises|, |*how much cats and rice arose?|
;; So it seems that we need a different split: one rule just for conjoined
;; mass nouns (the surprising case of agreement), and the second rule for
;; everything else.  Fortunately, |how much sand and gravel are needed| is
;; not too bad, so we can have the second rule uniformly take the CAGR.
;; DPF 2013-06-10 - But we still need to preserve DIV value on mother in
;; the "nondiv" rule, to block |*cat and dog arose|.  This is tricky, since
;; (a) we don't want to force identity of DIV on the two dtrs (|cats and
;; rice disappeared|), (b) if either of the two dtrs is DIV -, the mother
;; must be.  To avoid splitting the rule, we'll just stamp DIV - on the
;; mother, and accept the spurious second reading for |the sand and gravel
;; arose|.

;; DPF 2013-05-10 - Changed mother's PNG.PN to identify with right dtr's
;; ARG2..PN rather than its AGR..PN, since the AGR in the head-marker
;; phrase is not constrained.  This now correctly blocks |cats and dogs arises|
;; |the [cats and dogs] are ...|, |the [cats and rice] are ...|,

;; DPF 2017-10-07 - Re 2015-09-06: Well, but this also allows

;; special rule for the singular coord of mass nouns.  Not a perfect solution

;; the selected prep's MIN value.
;; DPF 2018-05-28 - For efficiency, it's tempting to add ALTMIN non_ellipt_rel 
;; to block unwanted ambig for e.g. |someone said that is|, but for now we make
;; use of this rule to handle elided relative clauses, as in |we have several
;; books that he doesn't|, where the locative PP-rel-pro `that' won't unify
;; with `books'.
;; DPF 2018-06-09 - Added quant_rel to bind the relative clause's MOD..--SIND,
;; since it doesn't get bound otherwise, for examples like |He left, which led
;; to trouble|, where the INDEX pointed to by "which" is not bound.  
;; But note that this leads to double quantification for examples such as
;; |We left, at which time he appeared|, where the variable for "which" is
;; already quantified.  FIX.
;; DPF 2019-11-15 - The restriction SUBJ..HEAD basic_noun strangely excludes
;; gerunds, as in |Buying stocks angered Kim, which pleased Browne.|  So
;; generalize to supnoun, and monitor.
;; DPF 2020-03-24 - Changed to ARGS.FIRST..SUBJ..HEAD supnoun from basic_noun

; to be inside SYNSEM, so can't identify synsems of hd-dtr and mother.
; DPF 19-sept-04 - Removed parent word_or_lexrule since this causes infinite
; recursion in generation with e.g. period, and it's not clear why we wanted

; DPF 11-oct-05 - This rule should ideally check for the presence of a
; matching right paren on the nh-dtr, but this can't simply be the value
; of RPUNCT, since we might have e.g. "The boss (Abrams), who arrived..."
; or "Kim hired the guy (Abrams); we approved."  More generally, we need
; to keep track of a paren being in the punctuation cluster, and presumably
; also for other right paired elements like quotes.  For now, we'll
; over-generate.
; DPF 13-sept-07 - Now trying out use of RCLSTR (right punct cluster).
; DPF 17-sept-07 - Constrained HD-DTR..SPR to determiner, to avoid spurious
; ambiguity for bare NPs.
; DPF 30-apr-09 - So let's try preserving the punctuation on the right dtr,
; so we can e.g. accept |Kim (Browne), the manager| using the hdn-np_app-idf_c rule
; which demands a comma on the hd-dtr.
; DPF 13-may-09 - Re 30-apr-09: Alas, this means the PSF (punctuation-derived
; sentence force) is carried up as 'comm' to the larger sentence - not what
; we want.  So instead for now leave RPUNCT unconstrained on mother, which
; means we also don't get the specialization of prop-or-ques in e.g.
; 'We hired Kim (Browne).'  FIX.
; DPF 14-may-09 - Allow both uninflected and inflected heads, so we can get
; e.g. |A (B) C| as compound noun.
; DPF 14-may-09 - Removed RPERIPH + on mother, since we want to allow e.g.
; 'the [cat (see illustration) in the room] slept'
;; DPF 2012-03-14 - Removed NH-DTR..--TPC -, since we want e.g.
;; |we admire him (in Paris, he is famous)|
;; DPF 2013-02-16 - Re 17-sept-07: Can't require HEAD det since we also want to
;; attach these to e.g. pronouns.
;; DPF 2016-10-08 - In order to allow post-modif as in the NP 
;; |artificial neural networks (ANNs) called marvels|
;; move identif of MODIFD for mother and hd-dtr down to subtypes, so we can
;; drop the identity for the nbar subtype.  Note that if and when we allow
;; pre-nominal mod before post-nominal generally, we can restore this identity
;; (FIX later).
;; DPF 2016-10-14 - We were constraining hd-dtr to have SPR.FIRST synsem ... but

;; DPF 2014-08-01 - Added unary and binary bridging rules to accommodate robust
;; full-forest treebanking.  The strategy is to pump each normal edge in the
;; chart to a "bridge head" edge via the unary rule, and then combine two
;; adjacent such bridge-head edges using the binary rule.  This strategy,
;; proposed by Woodley Packard, results in a mere doubling of the number of
;; edges in each cell of the chart, rather than the square of the number of
;; normal edges that resulted from trying just a binary bridging rule that
;; accepted either bridge or normal edges.
