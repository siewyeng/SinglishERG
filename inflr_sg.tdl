; CSY 29-12-2020 for nouns in the base form that are unspecified for number
;     5-1-2020 added in MIN nonpro so the rule cannot apply to pronouns?

; 2-3-2021 - find a way to add nonc-hm into the input such that proper names cannot undergo this
; 10-3-2021 - removed MINORS.MIN nonpro_rel and the nonc-hm
