# SinglishERG

A branch of the English Resource Grammar (ERG) that is used for Singlish. Created as a Master's Research project. It is published under the same license as the ERG, the MIT license.

The singlish subdirectory contains the files that have been added or in the
case of `parse-nodes.tdl`, cloned from the trunk and changed.
Refer to `ace/config-singlish.tdl` and `singlish.tdl` to see which files are in use.


To compile this grammar using LKB most conveniently:
* Under Lkb Top's Advanced menu, select 'Evaluate Lisp expression' and type in `(push :singlish \*features\*)`
* Load the ERG as usual, via the Load--Complete Grammar on the LKB Top menu: ``trunk/lkb/script``

To compile this grammar using ace:
* In the ERG directory
$ ace -G singlish.dat -g ace/config-singlish.tdl

To check the semantics:

```
$ echo "sentence" | ace -g [grammar].dat -Tfq
```

And to generate in another grammar:

```
echo "sentence" | ace -g [grammar1].dat -Tfq | ace -g [grammar2].dat -e
```

To generate from MRS:

```
cat [mrs] | ace -g [grammar2].dat -e
```

* to change the generation root, add `-r [root]` to the command
* and add `--disable-subsumption-test` for easier generation

When merged with the ERG, there are a few places outside the
`singlish` directory that refer to the files here:

* `../singlish.tdl` is in the trunk top level directory
* `../lkb/script` has the feature `:singlish`
* `../ace/config-singlish.tdl` contains the config for ace
* there are testsuites at `../tsdb/skeletons/singlish`
* there are gold trees at `../tsdb/gold/singlish`

In the github repository these are all local (ignore the `../`).

### Data
Data was extracted from examples on Wiktionary pages with words that were marked to be Singlish. It includes also the other non-Singlish definitions and usages of the words. The example sentences include some that are offensive and racist but they not taken out as it reflects how this variety is used.

To parse the data using ace (parts in brackets are optional)
* To parse with only top tree:
$ cat singlish/data/wikidata/wikiexamples_first300.txt | ace -g singlish.dat -Tf1 > /tmp/output.txt

* To remove lines starting with "#": `grep -vP "^#" wikiexamples_first300.txt | ace...`

*lexicon_goldtrees.tdl* contains the words added to the standard English lexicon when parsing the 30 Singlish sentences from *skeletons/treebankset*.
